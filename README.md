# Get-ExchangeMailboxes
Grabs every exchange account, then selects the desired properties, then saves that information to a CSV. Intended to be used to figure out licensing demands for Office365.

## Information
The server I was working with at this time was an Exchange 2010 box. You can try it with newer versions but your mileage may vary.
